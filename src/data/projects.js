        description: "This assignment was all about layout and readability. The inside of this pamphlet contains three recipes involving apples that I found online.

These alignments help the page look organized and clean despite the amount of information being given. (Made using Adobe InDesign, royalty free images and dafont.com)",

Adding a slightly translucent shape behind the text allows the reader to comprehend the content easily despite the busy background. (Made with Adobe Illustrator and dafont.com)",

        description: "To start this piece, I hand-drew one bird, one head, and one rain cloud. I brought them onto the computer, colored them, arranged duplicates, and formatted them in a way that allowed the pattern as a whole to continue seamlessly onto another square of the same pattern if it were placed on any side of the original. I then transformed the original square into a pattern swatch on Adobe Illustrator, which let me use my seamless pattern the same as any solid color when using Adobe software. As you can see, the pattern can then be sized up or down to any imaginable size. (Made using Adobe Illustrator)",
